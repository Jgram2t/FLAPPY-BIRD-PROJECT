- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)

# Flappy Bird FPGA

## Description

This project is a hardware-based implementation of the classic **Flappy Bird** game using Verilog HDL and an FPGA. The game generates a VGA display showing the bird, pipes, sky, and ground. The design uses VGA synchronization signals to control the display and updates the game elements in real time.

The player controls the bird by providing a **flap input**. Each flap makes the bird move upward, while gravity continuously pulls it downward. The player must control the bird's movement to pass through the gaps between the pipes without hitting the pipes, ceiling, or ground.

## Design

The design consists of a VGA synchronization module and the main game logic. The VGA synchronization module generates the horizontal and vertical counters, `hsync`, `vsync`, and the current pixel position used for drawing the game.

The main game module handles:

- Bird movement and gravity
- Flap input detection
- Pipe movement
- Collision detection
- Game-over state
- VGA pixel rendering
- Game restart

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [LibreLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/librelane/).
